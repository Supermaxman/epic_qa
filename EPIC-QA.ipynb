E.g., trends of revenues of different companies over the past six months, or different departmental store products' sales comparison over the past three months etc. However, user needs a fair bit of knowledge of the underlying database schema and acquaintance with the BI dashboard. This can be particularly challenging for users and organizations that are not tech savvy or do not have time and resources to do so. A recent BI tools survey 1 highlights that despite the market presence of a large variety of BI tools, about 38% of the users continue to use spreadsheets as the main reporting and analytics tool. The use of BI tools remains low at an average of 10-15% of the users. While spreadsheet tools like Microsoft Excel provide advanced analytics abilities, e.g., pivot tables, visual charts, ready-to-use functions etc, they still have the bottleneck that the user requires learning about these techniques and knowledge of the database and spreadsheet schema. Also it is our observation that spreadsheet reports are often generated targeting a wide variety of audiences within the organization making them bulky with tens of columns and thousands of rows.\",\r\n",

Finding insights from a series of spreadsheets of a report, without requiring pre-training or prior knowledge of the spreadsheet schema. 2. Allowing users to interact with the systems using a chatbot and semi-structured English commands to set individual preferences, and give personalized insights from the same spreadsheets there onward for different users. For instance, CEO and marketing manager of a company can both get different personalized insights from the same series of spreadsheets. Our goal is to build a system similar to the modern social media, where different newsfeeds are generated for different users from the same underlying data. Our system's focus is on the personalized newsfeed of insights generated from the same spreadsheets of organization reports, consumed over emails, chatbots, RSS etc. Figure 1 shows the high level architecture of our system. Insights Generator runs continuously accepting spreadsheets of different reports. In Figure 1 , R1, R2, R3 are three different types of reports, e.g., R1 can be product sales report, R2 new joinee and attrition report, and R3 bug report. R11, R12... represent periodic spreadsheets of report type R1 and so on. The engine does not impose any limit on the types of reports, the number of spreadsheets of each report, or their periodicity. It treats each report type and its spreadsheets independently.\",\r\n",

We consider each numeric attribute nj \\u2208 N , and create a timeseries key (ki, nj) (key-attribute KA pair). E.g., if R1 has Product-ID as the primary key, with Sales as a numeric attribute, the timeseries key for product with ID P 1234 is (P1234, Sales). Let the value of Sales for P 1234 in R11 be y1, in R12 be y2 and so on. Thus from R11...R1s spreadsheets, we form a time series for key (P1234, Sales) \\u2192 [(t1, y1), (t2, y2)...(ts, ys)], where t1...ts are the timestamps of the spreadsheets. A spreadsheet, say R14, may not have the specific key P 1234, in which case we do not enter (t4, y4) value in the timeseries, thus accommodating for disappearing and reappearing entities.

We use unsupervised learning methods based on -(1) trend analysis (linear regression), (2) mean squared error (MSE) of the fitted trend line, and (3) outlier scores of data points within the fitted trend, i.e., Cook's Distance 4 . As given in Section 2.1, we form NTS, RTS, CTS consisting of several timeseries based on the unique values of primary keys and categorical attributes in the spreadsheets. For each timeseries in RTS, NTS, CTS, we do linear regression and fit a trend line. We compute the mean squared error (MSE) of this fit, and compute Cook's Distance of each data point (ti, yi), (ti, ri), and (ti, ui) in each time series. For each time series, we pick the data point with highest Cook's Distance. Thus at the end of this exercise, each timeseries in NTS, RTS, and CTS has a (1) line equation with slope m and intercept b, (2) MSE mse, and (3) a point with maximum Cook's Distance mcd 5 . We use these three features for deciding relative ranking of timeseries within each of NTS, RTS, CTS as follows. The procedure is applied same way for each of NTS, RTS, CTS group timeseries and hence we do not mention group names explicitly. We sort timeseries in the -(1) descending order of m 2 (sharpness of the slope irrespective of whether the slope is rising or falling), (2) descending order of mse, and (3) descending order of mcd. In all, we get nine orderings of timeseries, three each for NTS, RTS, CTS.. LT5 Mean, Variance: When the length of a timeseries is less than or equal to five, we only compute the mean and variance of the timeseries points, for each timeseries in NTS, RTS, CTS. Thus for each shorter timeseries in NTS, RTS, CTS we compute -(1) mean \\u00b5, and (2) variance \\u03b1 2 .\",\r\n",

Attributes which are dependent on other attributes will have similar timeseries, and generate redundant insights. Similar timeseries can be identified using a variety of techniques such as Earth Mover's Distance, Euclidean Distance, Dynamic Time Warp etc., and they can be clustered so as to efficiently provide unique insights. We plan to analyse semantics of attributes using NLP techniques, so as to make better decisions in deciding how to process them.

Implicit in this assumption is the need to evolve adaptations in the new host species to exploit their cells efficiently. However, SARS-CoV-2 has required no significant adaptation to humans since the pandemic began, with no observed selective sweeps to date. Here we contrast the role of positive selection and recombination in the Sarbecoviruses in horseshoe bats to SARS-CoV-2 evolution in humans. While methods can detect some evidence for positive selection in SARS-CoV-2, we demonstrate these are mostly due to recombination and sequencing artefacts. Purifying selection is also substantially weaker in SARS-CoV-2 than in the related bat Sarbecoviruses. In comparison, our results show evidence for positive, specifically episodic selection, acting on the bat virus lineage SARS-CoV-2 emerged from. This signature of selection can also be observed among synonymous substitutions, for example, linked to ancestral CpG depletion on this bat lineage. We show the bat virus RmYN02 has recombinant CpG content in Spike pointing to coinfection and evolution in bats without involvement of other species. Our results suggest the non-human progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 was capable of human-human transmission as a consequence of its natural evolution in bats.\",\r\n",

      "            \"text\": \"Negative regulatory mechanisms of T-cell activation control inflammation in cancer, autoimmunity, and infections thus preventing excessive and prolonged inflammation which can induce tissue destruction, or immunopathology. Immune checkpoints such as CTLA-4 and PD-1 are well known examples of T-cell intrinsic regulators. Upon recognizing antigens, T-cells are activated and start to express PD-1 and CTLA-4, which in turn suppresses the two major signalling pathways for T-cells: T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling and CD28 costimulation. 1 In addition, the transcription factor Foxp3 can be induced in activated T-cells, especially in humans, and plays a key role as an inducible negative regulator during inflammation. 2 COVID-19 is caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The major symptoms such as cough and diarrhoea in mild to moderate patients can be understood through the type of tissues that can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of human cells through its spike (S) protein. Viral entry is enhanced by the type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2, which cleaves a part of S protein and thereby exposes the fusion domain of the S-protein. 3, 4 SARS-CoV-2 establishes infections through epithelial cells in the upper and lower airways, which express ACE2 and TMPRSS2. 5 In addition, the pro-protein convertase Furin activates the S-protein of SARS and SARS-CoV-2. 6, 7 Intriguingly, T-cell specific deletion of Furin results in the impairment of effector T-cells and regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and leads to the development of age-related autoimmunity, which is accompanied by increased serum IFN-g, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, and IgE. 8 In addition, Furin is preferentially expressed by Th1 cells and is critical for their IFN-g production. 9 As evidenced in a parasite infection model, Furin-deficient CD4 + T cells are skewed towards a Th2 phenotype. 10 It is poorly understood how SARS-CoV-2 induces severe infection in a minority of patients, who develop respiratory distress and multiorgan failure. These severe patients show elevated serum cytokines, respiratory failure, haemophagocytosis, elevated ferritin, Ddimer, and soluble CD25 (IL-2R a chain, sCD25), which are characteristic features of secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH)-like conditions or cytokine release syndrome (CRS). In fact, severe COVID-19 patients have elevated levels of prototypic CRS cytokines from innate immune cells including IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-10. \",\r\n",

Importantly, CRS in severe COVID-19 patients may be more systemic and involve a wide range of T-cells. Firstly, circulating T-cells are severely reduced in severe SARS-CoV-2 infections for unknown reasons 12, 14 . Intriguingly, severe COVID-19 patients show elevated serum IL-2 and soluble CD25 (IL-2 receptor a chain). 11, 12 Since IL-2 is a potent growth factor for CD25-expressing activated T-cells 15 , the elevation of both IL-2 and CD25 indicates that a positive feedback loop for T-cell activation is established and overrunning in severe patients.\",\r\n",

The most remarkable defect was the decoupling of Treg-type activation and FOXP3 expression, which normally occurs simultaneously to sustain the effector Treg population while inflammation is resolved. 34 This Treg-type setting is further enhanced upon activation, when Tregs begin to show the effector Treg phenotype, further upregulating the expression of the immune checkpoint molecules. Importantly, Tregs need to sustain FOXP3 transcription in a persistent manner across time, 38 otherwise they can downregulate FOXP3 expression and become effector Tcells. 39, 40 Since IL-2 signalling enhances FOXP3 transcription, CD25 + T-cells are likely to differentiate into FOXP3 + Tregs in normal situations. 23 However, in severe COVID-19 patients, those CD25 + T-cells are considered to be vigorously proliferating, whilst becoming multifaceted effector T-cells or dying, instead of maturing into FOXP3 + Tregs. Accordingly, we propose to define the unique activation status of CD25 + FOXP3-T-cells as hyperactivated T-cells (Fig. 5) .\",\r\n",

Thus, it is imperative to investigate if genes and metabolites associated with the disease conditions have any roles in promoting the differentiation of hyperactivated T-cells. Previous reports showed that Tregs accumulated in atherosclerotic lesions, 43 and FOXP3 expression was reduced in CD25 + CD4 + T-cells from patients with prior myocardial infarctions. 44 In addition, T-cells in patients with obesity may show different responses to T-cell activation. Intriguingly, leptin a key hormone produced by adipose tissue, is thought to prevent CD25 + CD4 + T-cell proliferation but is relatively deficient in obese patients. 45, 46 Furthermore, the function of Tregs is impaired in type-1 diabetes patients. 47 In addition, FOXP3 transcription is transiently activated in T-cells of severe COVID-19 patients but may be repressed due to their unique metabolic states. Tcell activation is dependent on glycolysis, which converts glucose to pyruvate, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which activates oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and generates ATP in mitochondria. 48 Treg differentiation is more dependent on OXPHOS and can be inhibited by glycolysis. 49 Importantly, our pathway analysis suggested that these metabolic pathways were altered in severe COVID-19 patients, although further studies on metabolism are required. Furthermore, the hypoxic environment in the lung of severe COVID-19 patients may activate HIF-1a, which mediates aerobic glycolysis, and thereby promotes the degradation of FOXP3 proteins. 50 The reduction of FOXP3 proteins may result in the abrogation of the FOXP3 autoregulatory transcriptional loop thus blocking Treg differentiation. 38 CD25 + hyperactivated T-cells also expressed PD-1, and PD-L1 expression in macrophages was increased in severe COVID-19 patients. This clearly shows that the PD-1 system is not able to control hyperactivated T-cells. \",\r\n",

This decade's first CoV, named 2019-nCoV, emerged from Wuhan, China, and declared as 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' on January 30th, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). As on February 4, 2020, 425 deaths reported in China only and one death outside China (Philippines). In a short span of time, the virus spread has been noted in 24 countries. The zoonotic transmission (animal-to-human) is suspected as the route of disease origin. The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable source of 2019-nCoV though further investigations needed to confirm the origin of the novel virus. The ongoing nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses as well.

      "of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Researchers have developed automatic document summarization tools and techniques, which intend to provide concise and fluent summaries over a large corpus of textual data [20] . Preserving the key information in the summary and producing summaries that are comparable to human-created narratives are the primary goals of the extractive and abstractive approaches for automatic text summarization [2] . News websites are a prime example of such techniques, where automatic text summarization algorithms are applied to generate news headlines and titles from the news content [31] . The shortage of labeled data for text analysis has encouraged researchers to develop novel unsupervised algorithms that consider co-occurrence of words in documents as well as emerging new techniques such as exploiting an additional source of information similar to Wikipedia knowledge-based topic models [37, 38] . Additionally, unsupervised learning enables training general-purpose systems that can be used for a variety of tasks and applications as strong classifiers [7] . In this regard, statistical models of co-occurrence such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [6] , discover the relevant structure and co-occurrence dependencies of words within a collection of documents to capture the distribution of topic latent variable from the data. Although an abundant timestamped textual data, particularly from social media platforms and news reports are available for analysis, the changes in the distribution of data over time have been neglected in most of the topic mining algorithms proposed in the literature [35] . For instance, time-series analysis on datasets over the events relative to 2012 US presidential election suggests that modeling topics and extracting summaries without considering the text-time relationship lead to missing the rise and fall of topics over time, the changes in terms of correlations, and the emergence of new topics [12] .\n",

      "In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model of topics over time with categorical time distribution to detect topical recurrence, designed as an LDA-based generative model. To achieve probabilistic modeling of narratives over topical trends, we incorporate the components of narratives including named-entities and temporal-causal coherence between events into our topical model. We believe that what differentiates a narrative model 2 from topic analysis and summarization approaches is the ability to extract relevant sequences of text relative to the corresponding series of events associated with the same topic over time. Accordingly, our proposed narrative framework integrates unsupervised topic mining with extractive text summarization for narrative identification and summary extraction. We compare the identified narratives by our model with the topics identified by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [6] and Topics over Time (TOT) [35] . This comparison includes presenting numerical results and analysis for a large corpus of more than one million tweets in the domain of disinformation campaigns conducted against the White Helmets of Syria. The collected dataset contains tweets spanning 13 months within the years 2018 and 2019. Our results provide evidence that our proposed method is effective in identifying topical trends within a timestamped data. Furthermore, we define a novel metric called significance-dispersity trade-off (SDT) in order to compare and identify topics with higher lifetime attractiveness in timestamped data. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed model discovers time localized topics over events that approximates the distribution of user activities on social media platforms.\n",

The most commonly used approach to topic modeling is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [19] . LDA is a generative probabilistic model with a hierarchical Bayesian network structure that can be used for a variety of applications with discrete data, including text corpora. Using LDA for topic mining, a document is a bagof-words that has a mixture of latent topics [6] . Many advanced topic modeling approaches have been derived from LDA, including Hierarchical Topic Models [15, 16] that learn and organize the topics into a hierarchy to address a super-sub topic relationship. This approach is well-suited for analyzing social media and news stories that contain rich data over a series of real-world events [30] . Topic models over time with continuous-time distribution [5] and dynamic topic models [35] intend to capture the rise and falls of topics within a time range. However, continuous-time topic models, such as beta or normal time distribution, cannot model many modes in time. Furthermore, the smooth time distribution over topics does not allow recognizing distinct topical events in the timestamped dataset, where topical events reflect the event-based topic activity fluctuations over time.\n",

To determine the values for hyper-parameters α and β and to investigate the sensitivity of the model to these values, we repeated our experiment with symmetric Dirichlet distributions using values α ∈ [0.1, 0.5, 1], β ∈ [0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 0.8, 1]. We observed that the model did not show significant sensitivity to the values of these hyper-parameters. Thus, we fix α = 1 and β = 0.5, both as symmetric Dirichlet distributions.

We measure the graph modularity to examine the structure of the communities in this graph. We observe the highest modularity score of 0.41 using modularity resolution equal to 0.85. Figure 2 illustrates a downsample version of this graph, where each color represents a modularity class. The edges of the graph are weighted according to the number of hashtags' co-occurrence in the document collection. Our modularity analysis suggests that few distinct hashtag communities exist. Additionally, the dataset under study contains tweets associated with a single domain. As a result, we assume the number of topics to be relatively low. To choose an appropriate number of topics, we repeated LDA with the number of topics as T ∈ [4, . . . , 20] with increments of size 1. We evaluated the c v coherence of topics identified by LDA and observed the highest coherence score for T = 5 and T = 5, respectively. Thus, we report our experimental results using these values.\n",

This ranking allows extracting the sentences with the higher scores of belonging to each topic. This is achieved via performing weighted sampling on the collection of documents based on the probabilities of topics per time category ψ and draw D documents from θ . The weighted sampling leads to drawing more documents from the time categories b k with a higher ψ as this time slices contain more documents related to the topic z.

For instance, the Twitter conversation cascades include replies, quotes, and comments, where replies and quotes duplicate the textual content. Therefore, we applied Jaro-Winkler distance over the timely ordered sentences and dismissed the sentences with similarity above 70%, while keeping the longest sentence. After removing redundant text as described earlier, we calculate the probability of each sentence s j by measuring the sum of the probabilities of topics for words w di ∈ s j . Then, we select the sentences with the highest accumulative probability of words w per topic z. Summary coherence was induced as suggested in [4] by ordering the extracted sentences according to their timestamps such that the oldest sentences appear first.

Table 3 provides a comparison for the SDT scores measured for the 5 identified narratives, using varying values of α. The illustration of the distribution of the extracted narratives can be seen in Figure 3a . We can clearly see in this figure that narratives 1 and 3 have the highest dispersity. On the contrary, narratives 4 and 2 have the highest significance. We compare SDT i for narrative i with the number of user activity associated with narrative z. The results suggest that SDT score can be used to identify the narrative with higher lifetime attractiveness in a timestamped dataset.

Narratives over topic Categories (NOC), a probabilistic topic model with categorical time distribution; and II. extractive text summarization. The proposed narrative framework identifies narrative activities associated with social media events. Identifying topics' recurrence and significance over time categories with our model allowed us to propose significance-dispersity trade-off (SDT) metric. SDT can be employed as a comparison measure to identify the topic with the highest lifetime attractiveness in a timestamped corpus. Results on real-world timestamped data suggest that the narrative framework is effective in identifying distinct and coherent topics from the data. Additionally, the results illustrate that the identified narrative distributions approximate the user activity fluctuations over time. moreover, informative, and concise narrative summaries for timestamped data are produced. Further improvement of the narrative framework can be achieved via incorporating the causality relation cross the social media conversation cascades and social media events into account.
