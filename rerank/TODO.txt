IR - necessary for a system on larger final eval
DONE 1.	expand doc qrels to passage qrels
DONE 2. 	allow passage qrels in dataset creation
DONE 3.	run indexer on expert corpus
DONE 4. 	get various BM25 passage runs
DONE 5.	run rerank using doc qrels expanded and using BM25 passage searches on corpus
Results are worse by a little from golden document annotations, but still good enough

Novelty - need for SIGIR paper
1. 	Run full document expansion on sentences (or maybe BM25 passages, determine efficiency) using TPUS and
	CACHE results, may take a while. Do on consumer prelim first for quick results
2.	Run query entailment model on expanded questions on consumer set,
	CACHE results and analyze. Look for ways to infer nuggets
3.	Look over other papers Dr. H sent and consider architecture changes and some fine-tuning with prelim dataset.
	Create prelim split for experiments, 80/20 over sentences with nuggets
	Consider interesting architectures, only focus on sentence-level since passage-level is likely too inefficient
